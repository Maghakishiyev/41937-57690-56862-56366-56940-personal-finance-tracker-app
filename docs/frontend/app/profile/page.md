# ProfilePage Component Documentation

## Overview

The `ProfilePage` component renders a user's profile page, displaying profile information, monthly reports, and an expenses table. It utilizes React, Next.js, and Valtio for state management.

## Dependencies

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- Valtio: State management library for sharing global state across React components.

## Components Used

- `LoadingIcon` from `@/assets`: An icon displayed during loading states.
- Custom containers (`ProfileInfoContainer`, `MonthlyReportContainer`, `ExpensesTableContainer`): Components that encapsulate specific sections of the profile page.
- State stores (`TrackStore`, `UserState`): Valtio-based stores for managing track data and user authentication state.

## Functionality

### User Authentication

- Checks if the user is logged in (`isUserLoggedIn`). If not, redirects to the login page (`/login`).

### Monthly Totals

- Fetches monthly total data (`monthlyTotals`) using `TrackStore.fetchMonthlyTotals` based on the current month and year.

### Loading State

- Displays a loading spinner (`LoadingIcon`) while user data (`isUserLoading`) or track data (`loading`) is being fetched.

### UI Layout

- Uses a responsive layout with Tailwind CSS classes (`w-fit`, `bg-white`, `px-6`, `py-8`, `rounded-xl`, `shadow-sm`, `mt-16`, `min-w-[1200px]`, etc.) to structure the profile page.

## Example Usage

The `ProfilePage` component is a key part of a larger application structure, providing users with an intuitive interface to view and manage their profile and financial data.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { useSnapshot } from 'valtio';
import TrackStore, { ITrackState } from '@/store/TracksStore';
import { IUserState, UserState } from '@/store/UserStore';
import {
    ExpensesTableContainer,
    MonthlyReportContainer,
    ProfileInfoContainer,
} from '@/components/ProfileComponents';
import { LoadingIcon } from '@/assets';

const ProfilePage = () => {
    // Component code as described above
};

export default ProfilePage;

## Notes
Ensure all dependencies (React, Next.js, Valtio, Tailwind CSS) are correctly set up in your project environment.
Customize UI elements, error handling, and styling according to your application's specific requirements.
Adjust paths (@/components, @/store, @/assets, etc.) as per your project's directory structure.
