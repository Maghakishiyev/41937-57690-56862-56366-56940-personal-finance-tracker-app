# LoginPage Component Documentation

## Overview

The `LoginPage` component represents a user interface for signing into an application using React and Next.js. It integrates with an API client for authentication and manages user state using a global store (`UserState`).

## Dependencies

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Valtio: State management library for sharing global state across React components.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling.

## Components Used

- `Image` from Next.js: For displaying images.
- Custom icons (`EnvelopeIcon`, `LockClosedIcon`): Used for enhancing UI elements.
- External images (`img`, `img2`, `UserAvatarIcon`): Displayed within the component.

## Functionality

### User Authentication

The component allows users to input their email and password for authentication using the `signIn` function from the API client (`./api`).

### State Management

- **Local State**: Manages form data (`formData`), field validation errors (`fieldErrors`), and error messages (`errorMessage`).
- **Global State**: Uses `UserState` from the `UserStore` to manage user authentication status (`isUserLoading`, `isUserLoggedIn`, `user`).

### Hooks

- `useEffect`: Redirects authenticated users to the profile page (`/profile`) upon successful login.
- `useState`: Manages component-level state for form data, field errors, and error messages.

### Event Handlers

- `handleChange`: Updates `formData` state based on user input and validates fields.
- `handleSubmit`: Handles form submission, triggers user sign-in process, and manages error handling and state updates.

### UI Elements

- **Styling**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design, layout, and styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across different screen sizes (`max-w-8xl`, `max-h-[85vh]`, etc.).

## Example Usage

The `LoginPage` component is rendered within a larger application structure, providing a user-friendly interface for signing in securely.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { signIn } from './api';

const LoginPage = () => {
    // Component code as described above
};

export default LoginPage;

## Notes
Ensure all dependencies (React, Next.js, Axios, Valtio, Tailwind CSS) are correctly set up in your project environment.
Adjust paths (@/components, @/public, etc.) as per your project's directory structure.
Customize UI elements, error messages, and styling according to your application's specific requirements.
