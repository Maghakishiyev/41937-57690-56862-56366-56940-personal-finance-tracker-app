# signIn Function

The `signIn` function is responsible for authenticating a user by sending a sign-in request to a specified API endpoint using Axios.

## Import Statements

```typescript
import axios from "axios";
import { SigninRequestData, SigninResponseData } from "./types";

## Notes
Ensure that Axios (axios) is properly installed in your project (npm install axios).
Modify API_BASE_URL to reflect the actual base URL of your backend API endpoint.
Adjust error handling and logging according to your application's requirements.

## Error Handling
if the Axios request encounters an error, it checks if the error is an AxiosError (axios.isAxiosError(error)).
If true, it throws an Error with the specific message received from the server (error.response?.data.message).
If false or if the error doesn't have a specific message, it throws a generic error indicating an unknown issue occurred during the sign-in process.
