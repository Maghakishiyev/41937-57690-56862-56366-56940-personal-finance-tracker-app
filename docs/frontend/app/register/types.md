# SignupRequestData and SignupResponseData Interfaces Documentation

## Overview

The `SignupRequestData` and `SignupResponseData` interfaces define the structure of data exchanged during the user signup process. These interfaces ensure type safety and consistency when sending data to and receiving data from backend APIs.

## Dependencies

- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- `IUser` interface from `@/store/UserStore`: Represents the structure of a user object.

## Interfaces

### `SignupRequestData`

#### Description

Represents the data structure expected when sending a signup request to the backend API.

#### Properties

- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.
- `password`: A string representing the user's chosen password.

#### Example

```typescript
interface SignupRequestData {
    email: string;
    password: string;
}
## Notes
Ensure the IUser interface (@/store/UserStore) is correctly imported and defined within your project.
Customize property names and types in SignupRequestData and SignupResponseData as per your backend API's requirements and response structure.
These interfaces promote type safety and facilitate easier data manipulation and validation within your application.
