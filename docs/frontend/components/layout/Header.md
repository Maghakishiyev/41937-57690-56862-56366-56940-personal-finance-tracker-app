Overview
The Header component is a React functional component designed to provide a navigation header for an application. It includes branding, navigation links, and user authentication controls.

Dependencies
React: The component uses React functional component syntax and hooks (useCallback, useEffect).
Next.js: Utilizes Next.js specific modules (Link, useRouter, usePathname) for client-side routing.
Valtio: Uses useSnapshot from Valtio for state management.
State Management
User State: Manages user-related state (isUserLoading, isUserLoggedIn, user) through the UserState store.
Additional Stores: Utilizes stores like UserAccountsStore, CategoriesStore, and TrackStore for resetting state on sign out.
Authentication and Routing
useAuthRedirect Hook: Ensures proper redirection based on authentication state (isUserLoading, isUserLoggedIn).
Router Management: Uses useRouter from Next.js for programmatic navigation (router.replace('/')).
Functionality
Branding: Displays a branded title (CashTrack) linked to the home page.
Navigation: Renders dynamic navigation links (Home, Profile, Track, Categories, Accounts, Stats) based on authentication status and current path.
Authentication Controls: Provides sign-in/sign-out links and user profile display.
Events
Sign Out: Implements a signOutClickHandler function to clear user data, reset state, and redirect to the home page on sign-out.
Styling
Tailwind CSS: Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling elements (bg-blue-800, text-white, text-lg, etc.).

EXAMPLE
import Header from '@/components/Header';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Header />
            {/* Other application content */}
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

Notes
Ensure that routes (/, /profile, /track, /categories, /accounts, /stats, /login, /register) correspond to existing pages or components in your application.
Customize styling and functionality as per your application's design requirements.
