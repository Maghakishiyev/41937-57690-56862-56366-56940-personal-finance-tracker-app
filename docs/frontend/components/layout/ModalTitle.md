Overview
The ModalTitle component is a React functional component designed to render a customizable title within a modal or similar UI component. It allows developers to specify the title text and optionally customize its appearance using CSS classes.

Props
title (required): Specifies the text content of the title.
className (optional): Allows developers to provide additional CSS classes to style the title. Defaults to 'flex justify-center items-center font-semibold text-2xl text-black' if not specified.

Example

import ModalTitle from '@/components/ModalTitle';

const ExampleModal = () => {
    return (
        <div className="modal">
            <ModalTitle title="Welcome to CashTrack" className="text-blue-500 text-3xl" />
            {/* Other modal content */}
        </div>
    );
};

export default ExampleModal;

Dependencies
React: The component uses React functional component syntax and JSX.
TypeScript: Defines an interface (CustomTitleProps) for type safety with TypeScript.

Functionality
Customizable Title: Renders a title (title) with customizable CSS styles (className) to match the design requirements of the modal or UI component.
Flexibility: Allows developers to adjust the appearance and size of the title easily by modifying the className prop.
Reusability: Can be reused across different modal or UI components within the application.
Notes
Ensure the ModalTitle component is imported correctly and accessible within your project structure (@/components/ModalTitle).
Adjust the className prop to achieve the desired visual styling for the title.
Customize the title prop to reflect the specific content that needs to be displayed as the modal title.
