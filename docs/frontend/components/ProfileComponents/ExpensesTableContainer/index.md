# ExpensesTableContainer Component

## Overview
`ExpensesTableContainer` is a React functional component that displays a data grid of transaction records, segmented by category (All Transactions, Income, Expense, Transfers). The component leverages several stores for fetching and managing state, including tracks, categories, and user accounts. It also includes a modal for editing transaction details.

## Dependencies
- **React**: Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo).
- **@mui/x-data-grid**: DataGrid component for tabular data display.
- **@mui/material**: UI components like Tabs and Tab.
- **valtio**: State management.
- **TrackStore**: Store for managing transaction records.
- **CategoriesStore**: Store for managing categories.
- **UserAccountsStore**: Store for managing user accounts.
- **TrackModal**: Modal component for editing transaction details.

## Component Breakdown

### Imports
- Import necessary modules and components, including state stores and UI components.
  
### State Management
- **modalOpen**: Boolean state to handle the visibility of the modal.
- **selectedTrack**: State to hold the currently selected track for editing.

- **handleRowClick**: Opens the modal and sets the selected track for editing when a row is clicked.

### Rendering
- Renders a `Tabs` component for category selection.
- Renders a `TrackModal` component for editing transactions.
- Renders a `DataGrid` component to display transaction records.
