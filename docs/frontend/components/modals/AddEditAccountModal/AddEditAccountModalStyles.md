Overview
The provided code snippet contains configurations and styled components using Material-UI's styled function. These styles are designed to enhance the appearance and layout of UI elements within a React application. Below, each configuration and styled component is detailed for clarity and usage guidance.

Usage
To integrate the styling configurations and components into your React application:

Import the Styles and Components:

import { style, deleteStyle, StyledDiv, StyledLabel } from '@/styles/ComponentStyles';
Replace '@/styles/ComponentStyles' with the correct path based on your project structure.

Apply Styles to Components:
Use the imported styles (style, deleteStyle) and styled components (StyledDiv, StyledLabel) within your React components as needed.

Styles and Components

These are JavaScript objects defining common styles for UI components such as modals or dialogs.
Properties include position, top, left, transform, width, bgcolor, boxShadow, borderRadius, px, py, display, flexDirection, and gap.
style is configured for a standard size, while deleteStyle is slightly wider (480px).
StyledDiv Component:

A styled div component created using Material-UI's styled function.
Specifies display: flex and flexDirection: column to arrange child elements vertically.
StyledLabel Component:

A styled label component created using Material-UI's styled function.
Configures styling for labels with properties like marginBottom, display: flex, alignItems, gap, fontWeight, fontSize, and color.

Example

import React from 'react';
import { style, deleteStyle, StyledDiv, StyledLabel } from '@/styles/ComponentStyles';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <div style={style}>
                <StyledLabel>Label 1</StyledLabel>
                <StyledDiv>
                    <input type="text" />
                    <button>Submit</button>
                </StyledDiv>
            </div>

            <div style={deleteStyle}>
                <StyledLabel>Label 2</StyledLabel>
                <StyledDiv>
                    <textarea></textarea>
                    <button>Delete</button>
                </StyledDiv>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
Dependencies
React: Utilizes React functional component syntax and JSX for rendering.
Material-UI (@mui/material): Incorporates Material-UI's styled function for creating styled components (StyledDiv, StyledLabel) and applying CSS-like styles.
Functionality
Enhanced Styling: Provides predefined styles (style, deleteStyle) for consistent UI presentation.
Custom Components: Defines reusable styled components (StyledDiv, StyledLabel) to maintain design consistency across the application.
Notes
Ensure all dependencies (React, @mui/material) are correctly installed and imported into your project.
Modify the styles (style, deleteStyle) and components (StyledDiv, StyledLabel) according to specific design requirements.
Adjust properties such as colors, spacing (gap), and typography (fontSize, fontWeight) within the styled components to match your application's visual identity.
