# Express Server Configuration Documentation

This documentation outlines the configuration and setup of an Express server using TypeScript. It includes details on setting up middleware, connecting to a MongoDB database, defining routes, and starting the server.

## Overview

The provided code initializes an Express server with TypeScript. It configures middleware for handling JSON and URL-encoded request bodies, enabling CORS, adding security headers with Helmet, and connecting to a MongoDB database. It also defines routes for handling authentication, file uploads, account operations, category operations, and track operations.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Web application framework for Node.js
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- `helmet`: Middleware for adding security headers to HTTP responses
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js
- Other dependencies as required by specific routes or functionalities

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and specify the required environment variables such as `PORT` and MongoDB connection URI.

3. Implement the server configuration by creating an Express application, defining middleware, connecting to the database, defining routes, and starting the server.

## Configuration

The Express server configuration involves the following steps:

1. **Import Required Modules**: Import necessary modules such as `express`, `dotenv`, `cors`, `helmet`, and route modules.

2. **Load Environment Variables**: Use `dotenv` to load environment variables from the `.env` file.

3. **Define Port**: Retrieve the port value from the environment variables or set a default port.

4. **Initialize Express App**: Create an Express application instance.

5. **Connect to Database**: Use `mongoose` to connect to a MongoDB database using the `dbConnection` function.

6. **Use Middleware**: Configure middleware functions for parsing request bodies, enabling CORS, and adding security headers.

7. **Define Routes**: Define routes for handling different API endpoints.

8. **Start the Server**: Start the Express server by listening on the specified port.

## Usage

Ensure that the MongoDB URI and other required environment variables are correctly specified in the `.env` file before running the server. Start the server by running the script that initializes the Express application.

```bash
npm start
```
