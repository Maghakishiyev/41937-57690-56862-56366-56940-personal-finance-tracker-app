# Account Model Documentation

This documentation provides details about the account model used in the application.

## Model Structure

The account model (`IAccount`) defines the structure of an account entity in the application. It contains the following fields:

- `userId`: The unique identifier of the user who owns the account. It is of type `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`.
- `name`: The name of the account.
- `emoji`: An emoji associated with the account.
- `description` (optional): A brief description of the account.

## Interface: `IAccount`

The `IAccount` interface extends the `Document` interface provided by Mongoose and defines the schema for the account model. It includes the following fields:

- `userId`: Type `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId`. Represents the user ID associated with the account.
- `name`: Type `string`. Represents the name of the account.
- `emoji`: Type `string`. Represents the emoji associated with the account.
- `description` (optional): Type `string`. Represents a brief description of the account.

## Usage

To use the `IAccount` interface in your application, import it from the specified module and define your account model based on this interface. Here's an example of how to define an account model using Mongoose:

```typescript
import mongoose, { Schema } from "mongoose";
import { IAccount } from "./path/to/IAccount";

const AccountSchema: Schema<IAccount> = new Schema({
  userId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User", // Reference to the User model
    required: true,
  },
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  emoji: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  description: String,
});

const AccountModel = mongoose.model<IAccount>("Account", AccountSchema);

export default AccountModel;
```
